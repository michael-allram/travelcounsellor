# Travel Counsellor 

A team project for the course "Web Services" at Innsbruck University.


## Structure

* We keep the main files (html + php) in the top directory. 
* CSS and JS files are kept in subdirectories.
* Project Material (for example Powerpoint Slides for the project presentation) are stored in the subfolder "Documentation"


## Technical hints

This git-repository is synced with the Plesk Server. Any changes to the master-branch are immediately synced to the server and active. 


## Final hint
Have a nice time and happy coding :)
