# Travel Counsellor

Travel Counsellor provides a convenient way to plan a trip.  
By combining Google maps, TripAdvisor and OpenWeather we provide the user with all the information they desire such as itinerary, landmarks and weather forecast.


# Services: Google Maps

We'll use GoogleMaps to display the itinerary as well as the estimated duration of the user's travel.


# Services: TripAdvisor

TripAdvisor will provide us with information on the area the user is travelling to.  
Because calls to this service are limited, we plan to store the results in our database.


# Services: OpenWeather

Thanks to OpenWeather we'll also be able to give the user weather informations for the trip.
