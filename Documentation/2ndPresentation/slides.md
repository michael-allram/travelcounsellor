# Plan

- After the first presentation some issues had to be addressed
- We've divided the work into different issues and are working on it individually and as a group


# Basic view and functionality

![draft](../draft.png "draft")

- As of yet, fairly rough design
- Mobile support


# Basic Weather API interaction

[comment]: <> (Alex TODO: describe progress in a few bullet points)


# Getting Geoposition

[comment]: <> (Michael/Tobias TODO: describe progress in a few bullet points)

- Is fairly simple with modern browsers
- However, it is not very reliable for machines without GPS (eg. desktop PCs)

# Basic Google places API interaction

- We can request and receive details about an selected area
- We order the results in a particular to present the most desirable results at the top
